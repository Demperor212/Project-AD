            <h1>Is my grade enough for IB?</h1>
            <p>
                Disclaimer: This is based on anecdotal experience.
                <br>
                <br>
                For Mathematics: If you are struggling (Lower than low 90s) in grade 9 math, do not choose IB math.
                <br>
                Rationale: Regular math is significantly slower in pace than IB math: You will have one free semester free of math; 
                For IB you will have consecutive math every day until the end of grade 11 (If you are Math Standard Level), until grade 12 (If you are Math High Level). 
                You will learn Math 31, and 35 if you are in HL. Those are calculus and are not required for regular programs.
                <br>
                HOWEVER: If you want to go into any sort of engineering, science or math in university, ignore all of the above: You HAVE TO have math 31 to 
                be even considered into most of these programs. You can take regular math 31 but IB will give you university credits so why not.
                <br>
                <br>
                For Science: If you are struggling (Lower than low 90s) in grade 10, do not choose IB sciences.
                <br>
                <br>
                For Social Studies: If you are dead (lower than low 80s) in grade 10, do not choose IB World History (Aka IB Social Studies)..
                <br>
                (If you are that bad the teachers would probbaly not give you recommendation anyways, so if a teacher decided to 
                not give you recommendation, don't fret because they are saving you from a fail in the subject)
                <br>
                <br>
                For English: I have no say in this yet, as my English IB HL will not start until January. Since me, an English as second language person 
                who just graduated from ELL in late grade 9, can get admissioned into ELA IB (Mid 80s average), I think it might not be too hard??? I will give you update once 
                I have one.
