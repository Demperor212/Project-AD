            <h2>What is Math 20?</h2>
            <p>Math 20 is the second mathematics course in high school
              and is a prerequisite for Math 30. In the case of IB students, 
              Math 20IB is a prerequisite for Math 30 SL and HL, and also Math 25 HL.
            </p>

            <h2>What's in Math 20?</h2>
            <p><i>Note: IB topics will appear not in their own section, ergo they will appear in the middle of non-IB topics. 
              This is because in most cases it makes sense to learn it there.</i>
              <br>
            <p>Math 20 and 20IB goes over six (6) units;

            <h3>Quadratic Functions and Equations</h3>
            <p>A quadratic function <i>always</i> has a degree of two (2). There are three (3) forms.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>General form</h4>
            <p style="text-align :centre;"><i>ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c</i></p>"
            <p>This form tells us the direction of opening and the y-intercept. 
                The y-intercept in this form is the value of <i>c</i>.
                The direction of opening is determined by the value of <i>a</i>:
                if <i>a</i> is positive, the parabola opens upwards;
                if <i>a</i> is negative, the parabola opens downwards.
                <br>
                For example: <i>3x<sup>2</sup> + 4x + 6</i> 
                <br>
                <img src="../images/general-form-example.png">
                <br>
                In this case, the graph intersects the y-axis at y = 6, or at the point (0.6) 
                and opens upwards because <i>a = 3</i> and <i>a</i> is positive
            </p>

            <br>
            <br>

            <h4>Standard/Vertex form</h4>
            <p style="text-align :centre;"><i>a(x - h)<sup>2</sup> + k</i></p>"
            <p>This form tells us the vertex of the parabola, the direction of opening, 
                axis of symmetry, and whether there is a max or min value. 
                The vertex in this form is the point (<i>h, k</i>).
                The direction of opening is deteremind by the value of <i>a</i> just like in general form.
                The axis of symmetry is the vertical line defined by <i>x = h</i>.
                The max or min value is also determined by <i>a</i>:
                if <i>a</i> is positive, there is a minimum value at the vertex (the parabola cannot go any lower than that point);
                if <i>a</i> is negative, there is a maximum value at the vertex (the parabola cannot go any higher than that point)
                <br>
                For example: <i>2(x - 3)<sup>2</sup> + 4</i> 
                <br>

                <img src="../images/vertex-form-example.png">
                
                <br>
                In this case, the vertex is at the point (3, 4), 
                the direction of opening is upwards because <i>a = 2</i> and <i>a</i> is positive, 
                the axis of symmetry is the vertical line <i>x = 3</i>,
                and there is a minimum value of 4 at the vertex, meaning the graph of the parabola may not go any lower than y = 4.
            <h5><i>A common mistake is mistaking <i>h</i> as <i>-h</i>, or vice versa. In the previous example, even though in standard form it is written
                <i>2(x - 3)<sup>2</sup> + 4</i> the value of <i>h</i> is NOT <i>-3</i> but is instead <i>3</i>. Again, standard form is written
                as <i>a(x - h)<sup>2</sup> + k</i>, so be careful with the signs.
            </h5>
            <br>
            <br>

            <h4>Factored form</h4>
            <p style="text-align :centre;"><i>a(x - r)(x - s)</i></p>"
            <p>This form is useful for finding the x-intercepts, which are also called the "solutions" of a function or graph. The x-intercepts are
                where the graph crosses the x-axis, or where y = 0. The x-intercepts in this form are <i>r</i> and <i>s</i>. As well, the direction of opening is determined
                by the value of <i>a</i> just like in general and standard form. Later on, you may encounter functions with more than two (2) factors, 
                but for now we will only focus on quadratics, because cubic functions are scary.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>For example: <i>-1(x + 2)(x - 5)</i> 
            <br>

            <img src="../images/factored-form.png">
                
            <br>
            In this case, the graph intersects the x-axis at x = -2 and x = 5, or at the points (-2, 0) and (5, 0),
            and opens downwards because <i>a = -1</i> and <i>a</i> is negative.
            </p>
