    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>After the Alberta Teacher's Strike, our team have realized the importance
        of having a learning website tailored for Alberta students so that students could
        have a better time self-tutoring. We also have long realized the lack of support
        for new-comer high schoolers and junior-high students currently considering 
        various high school programs. We hope that our website could help ease this 
        issue a bit.
