            <h1>Physics 20</h1>

            <h2>Prerequisite: Science 10</h2>

            <h3>Overview:</h3>
            <p>It is a very fun subject about discovering how this world work.
                The problem is that it is also not the easiest science ever.
                <br>
                <br>
                But you will survive. Proof: The authors did not learn a single bit in advance and 
                spent 1 hrs max per day on physics and got high 90s in the end.
                <br>
                <br>
                You will learn about dynamics (Gravity, Three laws of Newton's, Circular Motion)
                and waves (Simple Harmonic Motion, Waves) in Physics 20/IB.
                <br>
                <br>
                When you find some comcept that you don't know why (eg: Ok I know how to use the formula, but Why on earth is \(F = ma\)?)
                Gemini/ an ai you like would be your best friend. I would try to explain each formula here, but 
                as you may see, I am not the smartest student ever so there would be formulas I left unexplained. 
                That would be because of: 1, I forgot to explain that. OR 2, It is such a pain to explain the formula That
                your best bet is just to memorize it.
                <br>
                <br>
                Well, first thing you need to learn in physics, is that sometimes memorization 
                is better than understanding. If you can memorize and use a formula properly, 
                you are good.
                <br>
                <br>
                Second thing (I suppose I should leave this for future, but I fear that I would forget to mention it): 
                Unit Analysis save lifes. (Eg: When you see 1 newton, please also know that it is also 1 \(kgm/s^2\))
                <br>
                <br>
                Was I yapping to much?
                <br>
                <br>
                Anyways:
                <br>
