            <h1>Physics 20</h1>

            <h2>Prerequisite: Science 10</h2>

            <h3>Overview:</h3>
            <p>It is a very fun subject about discovering how this world works.
                The problem is that it is also not the easiest science ever.
                <br>
                <br>
                But you will survive. 
                <br>
                Proof: The authors did not learn a single bit in advance and 
                spent 1 hrs max per day on physics and got high 90s in the end.
                <br>
                <br>
                You will learn about dynamics (kinematics, gravity, Newton's Laws, that stuff)
                and waves (simple harmonic motion, wave phenomena) in Physics 20/IB.
                <br>
                <br>
                At some point during your reading of this website, and although it is our intention to prevent it,
                you will likely and inevitably stumble upon a concept of which you cannot find an answer to the <i>why</i>
                of the concept. <i>Why</i> is gravity 9.81m/s<sup>2</sup>? <i>Why</i> \( F = ma\)? For these questions, you can 
                try to use ai to answer them. Just know that you will inevitably stumble upon something you could not understand even
                with ai. It is normal. You just haven't learnt the way to prove it, its ok, leave it for now and memorize it.
                <br>
                <br>
                (In the case of why the developers took Physics, neither of them know)
                <br>
                <br>
                <i>Important note:</i> In Physics 20 and 30, memorization of formulas are important. Although you may be given a
                formula sheet, sometimes there are "shortcut" formulas of which may not be on the formula sheet. Therefore,
                it is in your best interest to try to memorize any formulas that appear.
                <br>
                <br>
                (That was the other dev's edit, which kinda got my point wrong. But yes, memorizing shortcuts are important, there is just 
                not many shortcuts in total if any) What I was trying to say is, when you don't understand something, its ok, if you know 
                how to memorize it and how to use it, you will get mark. And if you get mark, it is good.
                <br>
                <br>
                <i>Important note:</i> Unit analysis may save your life. This is knowing the exact, basic units behind a derived
                unit. Such as a newton, denoted <i>N</i>, a measurement of force, being equal to <i>kgm/s<sup>2</sup></i>. Although both
                are a measurement of force, you may find that if you cannot recall the formula to find force, you can at least guess it by knowing
                that you need to involve mass and acceleration.
                <br>
                <br>
                Developer's notes: Was I yapping too much?
                <br>
                <br>
                Anyways:
                <br>

            <p>Physics 20 and 20IB goes over those topics:
                (Sorry for being vague, I could not find my phyiscs 20 notes, will be more organized once I find them)
                <a href="#Vectors" class="scroll-button">Vectors,</a>

                Where Vectors is easier than Newton's, which is easier than Energy, which is easier than
                Circular Motion, which is easier than SHM and waves
                <br>
                <br>
                Everything that is not waves is interconnected; SHM and waves are interconnected
            
            </p>


            <section id="Vectors">
                <h2>Vectors</h2>
                <p>(To learn this, I assume you are: 1, human; 2, understand basic trigonomtery and what a right triangle is)</p>
                <p>I could finish this part up in one paragraph:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This is, however, also really important, the foundation of all phyiscs I should say.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    First, what is a vector?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A vector is a value with direction. Eg: Devin is running at 100km/h towards east. If I say: 
                    Devin is running at 100km/h, this is not a vector. If I say: Devin is running towards east, 
                    this is also not a vector.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A scalar is just a value. Eg: Devin is running at 100km/h.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Example of Vectors and Scalars</h2>
                    <table style="width:100%">
                    <tr>
                        <th>Vectors</th>
                        <th>Scalars</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Velocity</td>
                        <td>Speed</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Displacement</td>
                        <td>Distance</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Force</td>
                        <td>\(\left| Force \right| \)</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>n/a</td>
                        <td>Energy</td>
                    </tr>
                    </table>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When a vector is straight north, south, east or west, we are happy, but when a vector is slanted, 
                    we are sad because a lot of formulas we use must make sure every value is in the same 1D space. 
                    When we are sad, we want to break down the slanted vector into components (x component and y component)
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When we break it down into x and y components, it is really easy to analyze two different directions and 
                    then put them back together.
                    <br>
