            <h1>Physics 20</h1>

            <h2>Prerequisite: Science 10</h2>

            <h3>Overview:</h3>
            <p>It is a very fun subject about discovering how this world works.
                The problem is that it is also not the easiest science ever.
                <br>
                <br>
                But you will survive. 
                <br>
                Proof: The authors did not learn a single bit in advance and 
                spent 1 hrs max per day on physics and got high 90s in the end.
                <br>
                <br>
                You will learn about dynamics (Gravity, Three laws of Newton's, Circular Motion)
                and waves (Simple Harmonic Motion, Waves) in Physics 20/IB.
                <br>
                <br>
                At some point during your reading of this website, and although it is our intention to prevent it,
                you will likely and inevitably stumble upon a concept of which you cannot find an answer to the <i>why</i>
                of the concept. <i>Why</i> is gravity 9.81m/s<sup>2</sup>? <i>Why</i> am I taking Physics? For these questions,
                know that it is very likely that either the developers themselves had the same questions, they could not answer it
                themselves, or both.
                <br>
                <br>
                (In the case of why the developers took Physics, neither of them know)
                <br>
                <br>
                <i>Important note:</i> In Physics 20 and 30, memorization of formulas are important. Although you may be given a
                formula sheet, sometimes there are "shortcut" formulas of which may not be on the formula sheet. Therefore,
                it is in your best interest to try to memorize any formulas that appear.
                <br>
                <br>
                <i>Important note:</i> Unit analysis may save your life. This is knowing the exact, basic units behind a derived
                unit. Such as a newton, denoted <i>N</i>, a measurement of force, being equal to <i>kgm/s<sup>2</sup></i>. Although both
                are a measurement of force, you may find that if you cannot recall the formula to find force, you can at least guess it by knowing
                that you need to involve mass and acceleration.
                <br>
                <br>
                Developer's notes: Was I yapping too much?
                <br>
                <br>
                Anyways:
                <br>
                <i>"Welcome to hell". -2025, Mr. Horne, Sir Winston Churchill High School</i>
