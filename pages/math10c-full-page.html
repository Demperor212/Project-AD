            <h2>What is Math 10C?</h2>
            <p>Math 10C is the first mathematics course 
                in high school (in Alberta anyway) and is 
                a prerequisite to Math 20 and Math 20IB.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>What's in Math 10C?</h2>
            <p>Math 10C goes over three (3) main subjects;
